# DSA Learning Journey with PepCoding

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository! ðŸš€ This is a compilation of my journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, guided by the outstanding free content from PepCoding on YouTube, taught by the brilliant instructor, Sumeet Malik. Over the past three months, I have been diligently following these tutorials, and I am excited to share my progress with you.

If you are looking to enhance your DSA skills for interviews or to solidify your understanding, this repository is a great place to start. The code here adheres to best practices and covers a wide range of topics, with over 20 questions in each section to ensure comprehensive learning.

1. **Basic Programming with JAVA**
   - Fundamental concepts and syntax
   - Hands-on exercises

2. **Patterns from Beginner to Advanced Level**
   - Simple to complex pattern programs
   - Visual understanding of loops and conditions

3. **Functions & Recursion**
   - Understanding methods and recursion
   - Problem-solving using recursive approaches

4. **Arrays**
